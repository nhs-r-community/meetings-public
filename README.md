This repository is for sharing minutes of NHS-R Community Committees.

The minutes are checked at the next meeting to confirm they can be made public 
and, if necessary, remove information that may be confidential or sensitive.

The Committee's Terms of Reference can be found in the 
[NHS-R Way](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/nhsr-committee.html) Quarto book

## Any errors?

If you spot an error or have any queries, these can be raised as an issue on 
the repository or contact the NHS-R Community Core Team via the contact 
information in the 
[NHS-R Way book](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/index.html#contact-us).

## Special note of thanks

The set up of a repository for minutes was inspired from the work of 
[R Forwards](https://github.com/forwards/meetings-public)
