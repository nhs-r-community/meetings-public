# RPySOC 2024
Bookings for the RPySOC 2024 conference, which is taking place at the ICC, 
Birmingham on 21 and 22 November, will open on Monday 15 April.  We will also
put out a call for abstracts.  Thanks goes to Sam Hollings, Tom Jennett, 
Ellen Coughlin, and Neil Bray for volunteering to judge abstracts.  Thanks also 
goes to Pablo León Ródenas for agreeing to help with a scoring system.  
Zoë reiterated that anyone who has volunteered can opt out at any point, 
particularly if they find themselves over committed with work. 

All agreed that it would be good for day two to be Unconference and that would 
negate the need for AV on both days.  If this results in a reduced cost and a 
surplus, then consideration could be given to having an access fund for anyone 
who does not have budget to pay for travel to the conference. 
Action:  Bianca and Maciej to meet with ICC AV Team to ascertain reduced costs.  
  
# HACA
A large number of abstracts have been received for HACA so there may not be 
sufficient time for all workshops. 
Action: Zoë to speak to HACA committee to see if people want to run via the 
NHS-R Community and have recorded.  
Action:  Sam to contact Chris Mainey re Python for HACA
  
# Role and purpose of NHS-R 
The role and purpose of NHS-R has been on-going topic.  
The website carries the main strap line: Together we aim to promote the use of R 
in the NHS so that we can help improve our health and social care system using 
open-source data science solutions.  
The most succinct reference is on the Mastodon page:  A community of UK based 
analysts and data scientists working with health and social care data.
Action:  Zoë will streamline what has been written across the board. 

It is important not to overstep Python but support and collaborate without 
duplicating work. It’s important to try to have strong bonds with special 
interest groups such as Apha and Turing Way.  
More work to be done to make sure momentum between NHS-R Community and NHS Pycom.  
Action:  Sam / Zoe to invite Turing Way to conference.

# Fellowships 
Previously, the NHS-R Community had a range of different fellowship titles not 
all of which were clearly defined. All agreed that it would be good to reprise 
the Fellowship scheme as a way of acknowledging those members of the Community 
who go and above and beyond but it would be important to keep it simple. 
Action:  Zoë / Bianca to produce first draft 

# Social media 
Zoë is currently working on a new Quarto website which will link to the current 
Wordpress function for conference bookings.  Zoë is also looking at moving blogs 
over to the new website although this raises some copyright questions.  
Action:  Sam to check on blog ownership / copyright
Action:  Bianca to add to risk register
Going forwards we will state that anything contributed is under a CCO*
Action:  Bianca to add to future agenda
