## Notes of last meeting and action log 
The recording of the meeting on 29 Feb is now available as unlisted on YouTube.  An email with a link has been sent to all Committee members. 
  
## Date for opening Conference registration 
A ‘Save the Date’ was sent via Slack, Linked in and Mastodon on 6 March. 
Reminders for the HACA Conference abstract deadline will be sent and will use this as a ‘piggy backing’ opportunity to tell people “don’t worry if you missed the HACA deadline as we will be calling for abstracts for the NHS-R Conference (21/22 Nov) very soon”.  

Action:  Zoë / Bianca

We agreed to open the Conference registration in early April (once the HACA abstract deadline and closed and after the Easter break).
 
## Conference Theme 
We had a long and varied discussion regarding a theme for the conference.  In brief: 
-	A theme around how analytics can improve NHS health care and what problems are being solved.
-	Healthcare analytics is more about looking at numbers.
-	Giving attendees the tools to empowerment.  
-	Encouraging people to attend as a gateway to NHS-R.
-	A need to raise awareness that NHS-R works on a voluntary basis but there are costs associated with giving time.
 
## Conference Programme 
During discussion the following points were discussed
-	The whole of day two could be Unconference which would save on AV costs as currently costed at providing AV for two days.
-	The current AV package will provide a live stream via Zoom.  Consideration could be given to a more hybrid approach for those who are unable to attend. 
-	We could hold an open discussion about AI and Machine Learning. 

## Keynote speakers 
During discussion the following points were noted:
-	No response yet from the three people who were unable to speak last year 
-	Could we have remote presentations?  Or could these be done as separate workshops during the year?
-	Do we need keynote speakers?  Could day one focus on different aspects such as introducing tools, showing creative ideas and value of NHS-R and the whole of day two as Unconference?  No keynote speakers would give a more “egalitarian vibe”.
-	Presentation on what R means to you, your journey from Excel to R and Python?
-	Data mishaps – sharing experiences (possibly for Unconference as not recorded). 
-	Disaster recovery – what do we do when it happens.   
## Next meeting
All agreed to postpone the next meeting as it will clash with Easter break.  Action:  Zoë
