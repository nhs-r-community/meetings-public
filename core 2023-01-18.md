**Venue for conference**

* The venue is currently being held with payments being organised with a view to being paid in the new financial year. Once completed can announce the date publicly. In the meantime, we can start to think about the structure of the conference.

* Requesting abstracts – will need to ensure in line with HACA in July for people’s timing to submit.

**Purpose and focus**

* Purpose from 2018 “Promoting the use of R in healthcare”

* All agreed important to keep branding but look to expand idea that not just NHS and not just R and consider using this or similar as a strapline. **Action:** ZT to pull together existing communications around the purpose.

* The Committee will need to agree a Terms of Reference. **Action:** ZT to circulate Government Data Science Community ToR as a starting point.

* Also consider how working with other communities such as NHS.pycom could be beneficial towards clarifying purpose and focus. The next NHS.pycom meeting hasn’t been shared.

**Workshops and webinars**

* Over the last couple of years, we have run very well-received Introduction to R and R Studio webinars and workshops.

* Important to ensure momentum and get a programme of events for the coming year.

* The following suggestions were made by the Committee to successfully recruit people to run webinars and workshops:

* Present as an opportunity to develop presentation skills, promote their work and connect with others rather than just asking for volunteers;

* Asking for workshops/webinars on specific topics can often create a lot of interest;

* Use YouTube as a platform to request call for action;

* Consider putting on some presentation training;

* All encouraged to reach out to presenters who may be able to run a workshop or webinar of interest;

* Contacting previous conference attendees / speakers – ensure this is done within the constraints of data protection laws.

* The Committee also need to consider their communication strategy. The majority of conference attendees heard about the event via word of mouth/website with a very low number signing up via social media notices.

* Encouraging people to sign up to email newsletters may be a potential way to expand on current communications.

**Statistically analysis**

* There is a lot of data available from the various platforms on how many people engage on social media, how many attend training and how many watch via YouTube etc. Anyone who is interested to in taking forward some statistical analysis to contact ZT. **Action:** All

**Social media**

* All agreed to move away from using X (but not leave completely as the account name for NHS-R could be reused).

* LinkedIn may be an alternative along with Reddit which is a forum based platform.

**Future meetings**

* The Committee was meeting on a weekly basis to help with agreeing a venue quickly for the conference but will revert to fortnightly meetings for the time being. **Action:** ZT to update invitations.
